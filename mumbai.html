								<p>Strategically located a few minutes from the town centre, Chowrasta, The Route Planners offers splendid views of Mount Kanchenjunga, unmatched by any other hotel in the region. Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest peak, is the reason to be here.</p>
<p>
The hotel is an exciting blend of modernity and Victorian charm, perfect for those looking to explore the hill town or relax in comfort.
</p>
<p>
Sinclairs Darjeeling offers 46 rooms and suites. A special suite for Honeymooners opens out to a private balcony with unhindered views of the Himalayan mountain range.
</p>
<p>
Guests can enjoy their meals at the multicuisine restaurant overlooking a beautiful garden, wind down in the colonial style bar whilst enjoying a game of pool, and refresh with a cup of Darjeeling tea at the outdoor café.
The indoor games room offers a variety of board games, carom, and table tennis, and the sundeck and viewing gallery is ideal to soak up scenic views of the mountains.
</p>
<p>

The hotel's banquet hall is conveniently located and is a favoured destination for corporate and social functions.
</p>
<p>
Darjeeling, earlier referred to as "Dorje Ling" or the Place of the Thunderbolt is well known for its lush tea gardens, toy-train and the views of Kanchenjunga. The bustling town, referred to as the "Queen of hill stations", spells Raj nostalgia with its historical sites and legendary heritage. The warmth of the mountain people is another alluring draw of this hill station.
